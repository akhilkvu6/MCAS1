        <p>A web server is a system either software, hardware, or both that stores, processes, and delivers web content to users over the Internet using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.<br>
             When a user’s browser sends a request (like visiting a website), the web server responds by delivering the appropriate resources, such as HTML pages, images, videos, or data.<br>
             An HTTP server is a specific type of web server which is responsible for handling HTTP requests and responses. While all HTTP servers are web servers, not all web servers are limited to HTTP. Some web servers may support additional protocols like FTP or SMTP.<br><br> 


<h3>How Does a Web Server Work?</h3>
When a user accesses a website by entering a URL in their web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server hosting the website. The web server processes this request and returns the necessary resources to display the page on the user’s browser.</p>

<h3>Serves content:</h3>
Web servers store and deliver web pages and other files to users' browsers when they request them. 
Uses
<h3> HTTP(S):</h3>
They communicate using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) (or its secure version, HTTPS) protocol. 
<h3>Responds to requests:</h3>
When a user enters a URL in their browser, the browser sends a request to the web server, which then sends back the necessary files to display the page. 
<h3>Hardware and Software:</h3>
<h5>1)Hardware:</h5>
A web server can be a dedicated computer or a virtual machine that stores the web server software and the website's files (HTML, images, etc.). 
<h5>2)Software:</h5>
The core component is the HTTP server software, which handles requests and responses. Popular examples include Apache, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.
